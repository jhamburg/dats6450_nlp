    "## German to English Translation Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use a dataset of German to English terms used as the basis for flashcards for language learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use is in the `deu-eng.zip` file. Move it to your current working directory and decompress.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have a file called deu.txt that contains 152,820 pairs of English to German phases, one pair per line with a tab separating the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparing the Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to prepare the text data ready for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the raw data and note what you see that we might need to handle in a data cleaning operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here are some observations from reviewing the raw data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is punctuation.\n",
    "- The text contains uppercase and lowercase.\n",
    "- There are special characters in the German.\n",
    "- There are duplicate phrases in English with different translations in German.\n",
    "- The file is ordered by sentence length with very long sentences toward the end of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data preparation is divided into two subsections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clean Text\n",
    "2. Split Text\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Clean Text\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must load the data in a way that preserves the Unicode German characters. The function below called load_doc() will load the file as a blob of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line contains a single pair of phrases, first English and then German, separated by a tab character.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must split the loaded text by line and then by phrase. The function to_pairs() below will split the loaded text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to clean each sentence. The specific cleaning operations we will perform are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove all non-printable characters.\n",
    "- Remove all punctuation characters.\n",
    "- Normalize all Unicode characters to ASCII (e.g. Latin characters).\n",
    "- Normalize the case to lowercase.\n",
    "- Remove any remaining tokens that are not alphabetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will perform these operations on each phrase for each pair in the loaded dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clean_pairs() function below implements these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, now that the data has been cleaned, we can save the list of phrase pairs to a file ready for use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function save_clean_data() uses the pickle API to save the list of clean text to file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the example creates a new file in the current working directory with the cleaned text called english-german.pkl.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Split Text\n",
    "\n",
    "The clean data contains a little over 150,000 phrase pairs and some of the pairs toward the end of the file are very long. This is a good number of examples for developing a small translation model. The complexity of the model increases with the number of examples, length of phrases, and size of the vocabulary. Although we have a good dataset for modeling translation, we will simplify the problem slightly to dramatically reduce the size of the model required, and in turn the training time required to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will simplify the problem by reducing the dataset to the first 10,000 examples in the file; these will be the shortest phrases in the dataset. Further, we will then stake the first 9,000 of those as examples for training and the remaining 1,000 examples to test the fit model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Train Neural Translation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing the translation model involves both loading and preparing the clean text data ready for modeling and defining and training the model on the prepared data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s start off by loading the datasets so that we can prepare the data. The function below named load_clean_sentences() can be used to load the train, test, and both datasets in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# load a clean dataset\n",
    "def load_clean_sentences(filename):\n",
    "\treturn load(open(filename, 'rb'))\n",
    "\n",
    "# load datasets\n",
    "dataset = load_clean_sentences('english-german-both.pkl')\n",
    "train = load_clean_sentences('english-german-train.pkl')\n",
    "test = load_clean_sentences('english-german-test.pkl')\n",
    "\t\n",
    "# load a clean dataset\n",
    "def load_clean_sentences(filename):\n",
    "\treturn load(open(filename, 'rb'))\n",
    " \n",
    "# load datasets\n",
    "dataset = load_clean_sentences('english-german-both.pkl')\n",
    "train = load_clean_sentences('english-german-train.pkl')\n",
    "test = load_clean_sentences('english-german-test.pkl')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the “both” or combination of the train and test datasets to define the maximum length and vocabulary of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is for simplicity. Alternately, we could define these properties from the training dataset alone and truncate examples in the test set that are too long or have words that are out of the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Keras Tokenize class to map words to integers, as needed for modeling. We will use separate tokenizer for the English sequences and the German sequences. The function below-named create_tokenizer() will train a tokenizer on a list of phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# fit a tokenizer\n",
    "def create_tokenizer(lines):\n",
    "\ttokenizer = Tokenizer()\n",
    "\ttokenizer.fit_on_texts(lines)\n",
    "\treturn tokenizer\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "Similarly, the function named max_length() below will find the length of the longest sequence in a list of phrases.\n",
    "We can call these functions with the combined dataset to prepare tokenizers, vocabulary sizes, and maximum lengths for both the English and German phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to prepare the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each input and output sequence must be encoded to integers and padded to the maximum phrase length. This is because we will use a word embedding for the input sequences and one hot encode the output sequences The function below named encode_sequences() will perform these operations and return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# encode and pad sequences\n",
    "def encode_sequences(tokenizer, length, lines):\n",
    "\t# integer encode sequences\n",
    "\tX = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(lines)\n",
    "\t# pad sequences with 0 values\n",
    "\tX = pad_sequences(X, maxlen=length, padding='post')\n",
    "\treturn X\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output sequence needs to be one-hot encoded. This is because the model will predict the probability of each word in the vocabulary as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function encode_output() below will one-hot encode English output sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# one hot encode target sequence\n",
    "def encode_output(sequences, vocab_size):\n",
    "\tylist = list()\n",
    "\tfor sequence in sequences:\n",
    "\t\tencoded = to_categorical(sequence, num_classes=vocab_size)\n",
    "\t\tylist.append(encoded)\n",
    "\ty = array(ylist)\n",
    "\ty = y.reshape(sequences.shape[0], sequences.shape[1], vocab_size)\n",
    "\treturn y\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make use of these two functions and prepare both the train and test dataset ready for training the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use an encoder-decoder LSTM model on this problem. In this architecture, the input sequence is encoded by a front-end model called the encoder then decoded word by word by a backend model called the decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function define_model() below defines the model and takes a number of arguments used to configure the model, such as the size of the input and output vocabularies, the maximum length of input and output phrases, and the number of memory units used to configure the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained using the efficient Adam approach to stochastic gradient descent and minimizes the categorical loss function because we have framed the prediction problem as multi-class classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model configuration was not optimized for this problem, meaning that there is plenty of opportunity for you to tune it and lift the skill of the translations. I would love to see what you can come up with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluate Neural Translation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also evaluate the model on the train and the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model should perform very well on the train dataset and ideally have been generalized to perform well on the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would use a separate validation dataset to help with model selection during training instead of the test set. You can try this as an extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation involves two steps: first generating a translated output sequence, and then repeating this process for many input examples and summarizing the skill of the model across multiple cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with inference, the model can predict the entire output sequence in a one-shot manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can perform this mapping for each integer in the translation and return the result as a string of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function predict_sequence() below performs this operation for a single encoded source phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# generate target given source sequence\n",
    "def predict_sequence(model, tokenizer, source):\n",
    "\tprediction = model.predict(source, verbose=0)[0]\n",
    "\tintegers = [argmax(vector) for vector in prediction]\n",
    "\ttarget = list()\n",
    "\tfor i in integers:\n",
    "\t\tword = word_for_id(i, tokenizer)\n",
    "\t\tif word is None:\n",
    "\t\t\tbreak\n",
    "\t\ttarget.append(word)\n",
    "\treturn ' '.join(target)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Next, we can repeat this for each source phrase in a dataset and compare the predicted result to the expected target phrase in English. We can print some of these comparisons to screen to get an idea of how the model performs in practice. We will also calculate the BLEU scores to get a quantitative idea of how well the model has performed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLEU\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluate_model() function below implements this, calling the above predict_sequence() function for each phrase in a provided dataset."
