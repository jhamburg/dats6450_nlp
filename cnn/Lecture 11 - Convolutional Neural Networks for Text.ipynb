    "# Convolutional Neural Networks for Text\n",
    "(adapted from Debajyoti Datta)\n",
    "\n",
    "**CNNs have become widely popular in text classification systems. CNNs help in reduction in computation by exploiting local correlation of the input data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/conv.001.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the green boxes represent the words or the characters depending on your approach. If you are using character based convolutional neural network then it is characters whereas if you are using words as a unit then it is the word based convolution. And the corresponding blue rows represent the representation of the words or the characters. In the case of character based convolutions, since the number of characters was around 70, including punctuations, numbers, and alphabets, this is generally the one-hot representation. In the case of words, the blue boxes generally represent dense vectors. These dense vectors can be pre-trained word embeddings or word vectors trained during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- <img src=\"conv/conv.002.png\",width=550,height=550> -->\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/conv.002.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now as you can see, filters (also known as kernels) can be of any length. Here the length refers to the number of rows of the filter. In the case of images, the width and length of the kernel can be any size. But the width of the kernel in case of character and word representations is the dimension of the entire word embedding or the entire character representation. Thus the only dimension that matters in the case of convolutions in NLP tasks, is the length of the filter or the size of the filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the filters need to convolve with the input and produce the output. Convolve is a fancy term for multiplication with corresponding cells and adding up the sum. This part is slightly tricky to understand and varies based on things like stride (How much the filter moves every stage?) and the length of the filter. The output of the convolution operation is directly dependent on these two aspects. This will become clearer in the following image.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- <img src=\"conv/conv.003.png\",width=300,height=300>\n",
    "<img src=\"conv/conv.004.png\",width=300,height=300>\n",
    "<img src=\"conv/conv.005.png\",width=300,height=300>\n",
    "<img src=\"conv/conv.006.png\",width=300,height=300> -->\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/conv.003.png)\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/conv.004.png)\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/conv.005.png)\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/conv.006.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is where all the interesting bit happens! The convolution is just the multiplication of the weights in the filters and the corresponding representation of the words or characters. Each of the output of the multiplication is then just summed up and it produces one output, shown with the arrow. Thus if the filter would have moved with a stride of 2, then the number of filter outputs would have been different. If the filter length was different, the convolved output would be different. Convince yourself that the filter of the length 4, when convolved, will just produce 2 outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like multiple filter lengths, there can be multiple filters of the same length. So there can be a 100 filters of length 2, a hundred filters of length 4 and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these will then produce multiple outputs!\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- <img src=\"conv/conv2.006.png\",width=400,height=400> -->\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/conv2.006.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final stage comprises of max pooling then concatenation and softmax regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- <img src=\"conv/conv2.007.png\",width=300,height=300> -->\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/conv2.007.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire process was very nicely illustrated by Zhang et al, in the paper \"A Sensitivity Analysis of (and Practitionersâ€™ Guide to) Convolutional\n",
    "Neural Networks for Sentence Classification\", for words. The above is just replicating the same for characters and how it would appear at every step!\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- <img src=\"conv/Zhang.png\",width=400,height=400> -->\n",
    "\n",
    "![png](./assets/images/Zhang.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The task we are trying to accomplish here is to classify text. Specifically, the input to the convolutional network can be words or characters like we discussed before. Here, from the sequence of words, in a sentence or from the sequence of characters in a sentence we would want to classify the category of the sentence, like positive or negative and so on."

Also, you can define custom rules in Spacy to take these into account. Secondly, another option that is often followed in information retrieval approaches is to get rid of the most frequent words. This is because words like 'the', 'an' and so on occur very frequently and do not add to the meaning.
