procurator who sends for marcellus to take charge of the detail of roman soldiers assigned to crucify him as pilate finishes washing his hands he tells marcellus that he is being recalled to italy by the emperor and tells marcellus of the duty he must perform before he leaves as marcellus leaves pilate pines about the past night and asks for water so that he can wash his hands again marcellus and the other soldiers cast lots for jesus robe and marcellus wins on the way back into jerusalem marcellus compels demetrius to throw the robe over him as the two of them are caught in the rain it is then that marcellus begins to feel remorse for the crucifixion of jesus when the robe is on him he has painful seizure and he orders demetrius to take it off him when demetrius does so he has had enough he curses marcellus and the roman empire and runs away marcellus now behaves like madman haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion what sets him off is any reference to being out there on calvary he cries out fitfully were you out there he does this in the presence of tiberius himself when he reports to him on capri tiberius is portrayed as benevolent elder statesman who wants to help marcellus so at the prompting of his soothsayer dodinius and marcellus own enthusiasm he gives him an imperial commission to find and destroy the robe while gathering list of names of jesus followers at diana request tiberius leaves her free to marry marcellus even though tiberius believes him to be mad after leaving capri marcellus is next seen sometime later with syrian guide abidor outside the village of cana he is posing as cloth merchant going about buying up homespun cloth to further his investigation marcellus pays exorbitant prices for any kind of cloth even rags justus weaver in cana reprimands his fellow christians for accepting such unfair prices as being contrary to the teachings of jesus and his fellow christians give back the excess amounts voluntarily seeing justus as lead in his investigations marcellus seeks to ingratiate himself with justus by giving his young grandson jonathan whose club foot had been healed by jesus one of his pack donkeys marcellus also wanders in on public performance by the paralytic miriam as she sings song of jesus resurrection when marcellus returns to his camp he is confronted by greedy abidor who wants to turn in justus and the others to pilate who has ordered the arrest of jesus followers abidor who is obsessed with making money threatens to tell the people of cana that marcellus crucified jesus which drives marcellus to beat abidor and send him away violently the next day marcellus is furious with jonathan for giving his donkey to his physically challenged friend david because he did not yet understand the teachings of jesus miriam who is sitting nearby kindly confronts marcellus and urges him to see peter who has come to cana with greek companion marcellus guesses that this is demetrius and goes off to shalum inn to confront him marcellus finds demetrius alone and demands that he get the robe and destroy it demetrius gives the robe to marcellus who refuses to touch it and demetrius tells him that if he wants it destroyed he will have to destroy it himself marcellus picks the robe up with his sword and as he becomes frozen with fear the robe slides down the sword onto him he is terrified but this time as the robe touches him he finds that the pain he has been carrying since the robe first touched him vanishes and that he is no longer afraid he feels the true power of the robe and of the one who wore it in that moment marcellus believes in jesus christ is relieved from the madness of his guilt and becomes christian the two men go outside and justus calls the villagers together and begins to introduce peter justus tells the gathered crowd that on the night of jesus arrest only peter stood by jesus peter tries to correct justus but justus tells peter that his turn to speak will come and continues suddenly justus is pierced by an arrow and falls the assembly turns to see paulus and large detachment of roman soldiers with the gloating abidor lurking among them several other villagers are killed before marcellus intervenes ordering them to stop paulus informs him that his orders are no longer valid tiberias is dead and caligula is emperor marcellus informs paulus that an imperial commission is valid even after roman emperor dies paulus tells marcellus to make him obey via sword duel marcellus asks paulus if he will keeps his word to withdraw the troops if marcellus wins the duel paulus says that if marcellus wins the troops are his because paulus will be dead marcellus accepts the challenge to duel after prolonged struggle marcellus prevails rather than killing paulus as is expected of him marcellus hurls his sword into tree he challenges paulus to give the order to his soldiers to withdraw paulus recognizing the mercy extended to him by marcellus salutes marcellus and orders the soldiers to leave peter invites marcellus to join him and demetrius as missionaries marcellus hesitates and when peter tells him that he denied jesus three times on the night he was arrested marcellus confesses his role in jesus death peter points out to him that jesus forgave him from the cross in the dramatic words showcased before father forgive them for they know not what they do marcellus then pledges his life to jesus and agrees to go with them their missionary journey takes them through antioch ephesus corinth and then to rome but they must proceed undercover with their base in the catacombs because the emperor caligula has proscribed them in rome caligula summons diana from her retreat at the gallio home to tell her that marcellus has become traitor to rome by being christian he takes her to the guard room where captured demetrius is being tortured diana runs out of the palace to marcipor the gallio family slave who is secret christian diana guesses that marcipor is christian and has seen marcellus and she gets him to take her to marcellus marcellus and diana are reunited and marcellus tells her the story of the robe and his own conversion but diana only thinks the story of jesus justice and love is nice story but that the world doesn work that way diana gives marcellus information on where demetrius is in the imperial palace and marcellus and his fellow christians manage to rescue him they are almost too late as demetrius is near death but peter comes to the gallio home where demetrius has been taken and heals him caligula scolds his roman soldiers for letting the prisoner get away and issues orders to bring marcellus to him alive to stand trial by the end of the day or they will all be sent to the galleys physician friend of senator gallio marius is called in to help demetrius but is unable to heal him marius states that science has limits marcellus prays to god and peter then knocks on the door and ask to be alone with demetrius peter lays his hand on demetrius and heals him marius proud man is resentful of peter ability to heal demetrius and leaves with the purpose of betraying marcellus to caligula marcellus tells his father senator gallio that he wants to return and tell his father more about christianity however his father says this will be the last time they see each other because he feels his son has betrayed rome by becoming christian and therefore he no longer has son marcellus promises diana that he will send for her tomorrow and kisses diana as he leaves marcellus flees with demetrius but when they are pursued by soldiers marcellus gives himself up so that demetrius can escape he is captured and put on trial diana visit marcellus in prison on the night before his trial and requests he not defy caligula marcellus tells diana of miriam the crippled girl who found herself fortunate to be lame of the poor young boy jonathan to whom marcellus gave the fine donkey and he then selflessly gave it away to another boy without second thought and how other christians do not deny christ to save their skin diana wants to believe but does not feel she can if marcellus dies if he dies now diana tells him that she feels his death would be for nothing and that she needs marcellus caligula makes diana sit next to him for marcellus trial he then tells the crowd of senators and roman nobles that there is secret party of seditionists called christians and how their actions are comparable to the traitor spartacus he then tells them that one of their own marcellus has joined these conspirators and thus is being tried by all of them for treason marcellus informs the crowd that it is true that he is christian however he denies the charge that christians are plotting against the state when caligula says that christians believe jesus is king marcellus tells everyone that jesus is king but that his kingdom is not of this world and jesus seeks to reign in the hearts and mind in the name of justice and charity caligula asks about the robe that marcellus is holding and marcellus tries to show caligula his opportunity to accept christ marcellus tries to hand the robe to caligula but caligula refuses to touch it as he considers it to be bewitched he orders one of his soldiers to take the robe and destroy it but diana asks to keep it instead marcellus informs caligula that if rome turns to the ways of justice and charity then rome will be saved however if rome stayed on its present course then it would be destroyed to the crowd this sounds treasonous and caligula condemns marcellus to death by the wish of the members of the audience based on what they ve heard caligula in an effort to show mercy to marcellus tells him to renew his allegiance to rome and renounce his faith in jesus christ marcellus kneels to caligula to renew his pledge to rome pledge he states that he has never broken but then stands and states that he cannot renounce his belief in jesus marcellus tells caligula that jesus is his king and caligula king and that jesus is the son of god diana then accepts christ and seeks to join marcellus the man she considers to be her husband in his kingdom when caligula tells diana that there are no charges against her she provides reason for her to be charged with the same crime as marcellus by telling the audience how evil an emperor caligula is caligula screams out as she states her condemnation of his rules and then condemns diana to die alongside marcellus as diana and marcellus are marched out of the emperor court diana hands the robe to marcipor diana and marcellus pause to smile at each other as they peacefully walk out of the courtroom to meet their earthly fate chorus of hallelujah plays and clouds are in the background behind diana and marcellus as

       " 'the film is depiction of various scenes usually violent or bizarre that somehow relate to hunting each scenario is presented one after the other with little regard for narrative continuity goodall the opening scene introduces patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive the opening credits play over as he chases after stag which he ultimately shoots kills and beheads afterwards one of the numerous scenes of anti hunting gatherings is shown this one in cape cod the attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting where monkey is killed by leopard and then squirrel monkey by an anaconda the theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in australia and africa aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs indigenous tribes of africa hunt large game including antelope buffalo and elephants in the savanna religious ceremonies are also shown where the african hunters proceed to suck fresh blood from the entrails of an antelope and the australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals lastly two brothers are arrested after partaking in form of ritual post mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead other hunting traditions then follow again rooted in religion the warriors of the kuru tribe in africa commit sacred act in which they copulate with the ground in belief that it will make the earth fertile and produce animals for the hunt and stag hunt in france rooted in ancient pagan beliefs of the gauls is blessed by mass before the hunt takes place during which the hunters and dogs chase and ultimately kill fleeing stag in fox hunt the wild fox association sabotages the hunting efforts by serving wine laced with laxative to the hunters and distracting the dogs with an afghan bitch in heat their efforts are then connected to species conservation and to exemplify that hunters are truly concerned in wildlife conservation argentine hunters capture an andean condor to sell to zoo collage of other conservation efforts is shown including the tagging of white rhinoceroses grizzly bears and elephants which are shot with morphine darts argentinian deer and elephant seals are physically subdued and marked tourists on africans safaris then come to view the conservation efforts which the narrator claims to have seemingly negated the animals violent instincts this deception is demonstrated with the mauling of tourist named pit dernitz by lions another anti hunting demonstration becomes the film focus this time on the isle of wight nudity and intercourse are practiced freely amongst the demonstrators and this is contrasted with ancient hunter gathering groups who had strict rules concerning nudity the narrator argues that once hunting had left this group of people so did their rules toward nudity also highlighted is the contradiction that though this people are against hunting thousands of farm raised animals had to die to support them the focus changes to humboldt penguins which cannot hunt because of polluted waters and thus seem detached and without focus this effect is compared to modern day eskimos who no longer hunt since the discovery of oil in their homeland and have fallen into depression and melancholy to reverse the process several groups of men go out and revive their hunting ways reflected in this is montage of gun ownership which the film relates to feelings of masculinity followed by shots of illegal elephant poaching from africa to offset the dwindling number of game due to poaching warriors from the lobi tribe celebrate the ceremony of life in which they masturbate with ceremonial rods and pour the product into the river hoping the animals will drink the semen and multiply attention shifts to large electronic probes in the peruvian savanna used to measure the winds of el niño for optimal fishing conditions fishing birds are also electronically tagged so the prime fishing areas can be located based on the birds fishing habits this fish frenzy in south america is reflected in the salmon run in alaska where kodiak bears hunt and fight for prey an examination of hunting tradition in northern europe follows where falcons assist humans in hunting by catching wild game such as rabbits and pheasants further collaboration with man and animal is highlighted this time with cheetahs to demonstrate the cheetah speed and effectiveness chase between group of cheetahs and ostriches is arranged in which the birds are hunted down and killed the next animal collaborators are dogs which hunt wild boar in patagonia and puma which has attacked herd of sheep and shepherd in cities however stray dogs are the ones hunted by dog catchers which the narrator claims demonstrates that the hunt is still active but the prey has changed indios also use dogs to hunt monkeys but their efforts are compared to mercenaries hunting the indios themselves to clear them from their native land for development in one such instance mercenaries retaliate against death of workman by hunting down group of indios one of which they torture castrate and murder various scenes of wildlife are then shown after which orangutans are hunted to be sold to zoos the film then ends with the coexistence of man and animal between erik zimen an ecologist and wolves the group of animals he wishes to save',\n",

different locations throughout chennai which are programmed to explode simultaneously within four hours the common man demands that he would like to negotiate with senior government official maraar seeks the services of the chief secretary lakshmi to act as the negotiator maraar also alerts his team involved in intelligence research and surveillance tapping all the available resources in gathering preliminary information and tracing the location of the caller meanwhile the caller tips off television news reporter natasha rajkumar telling her to reach anna salai police station immediately as it is going to be the most important day of her life maraar initially suspects the anonymous caller to be bluffing but his doubts are dispelled as the caller to prove his seriousness and the police force helplessness reveals that bomb has been planted in the anna salai police station when the bomb disposal squad find the bomb there is only minutes left the common man calls maraar and tells him the instructions to deactivate the bomb based on these the bomb is defused natasha reaches the scene on the caller instructions and reports about the situation there is intense debate between maraar and the chief secretary on who would act as the negotiator with the common man the chief minister does not want to get into this and the chief secretary also does not want to take upon the responsibility hence maraar himself takes on the role of the negotiator with the common man the common man demands the release of four terrorists abdullah inayadullah ahamadullah and karamchand lala who have been involved in and arrested for many of the major terrorist attacks and activities that have happened in the country during the previous decade maraar cleverly uses natasha to fake report on live television that four terrorists are being relocated to an undisclosed common site turning the caller tool back onto him maraar men find out that the caller is using advanced software to automatically switch the numbers and locations of his mobile phone sim card every minute rendering their manpower and the obsolete equipments useless and prompting them to employ the services of young hacker who turns out to be an iit dropout in the meantime maraar is also able to obtain facial composite of the caller with help of the police officer to whom the caller had approached to lodge the fake fir during the earlier scenes of the film but much of the time passes without any concrete results on the identity or the location of the caller ultimately maraar agrees with the caller demand and puts two of his best men arif khan and sethuraman in charge of handing over the four terrorists at the sozhavaram airstrip once there the caller confirms the identity of all the four men via conference call with arif and maraar and then asks arif and sethu to unlock their handcuffs and leave them alone at particular spot sethu orders his men to do as told but at the last moment arif decides not to hand over abdullah to ensure all the information regarding the locations of the bombs can be forced out from the caller sethu argues with arif and demands he do as ordered but arif forcefully grabs the terrorist and starts walking away as they leave behind the remaining three the caller unaware of the ongoing fiasco uses cell phone placed in rigged jeep at the spot to detonate an explosion in which all the three terrorists perish arif relays this information to maraar which is confirmed by the anonymous caller as he reveals that he is just stupid common man not belonging to any terrorist outfit and his plan was not to free the terrorists but to kill them avenging all the terrorist attacks they had helped carry out in coimbatore and other major cities of india thus cleaning the roach infested house maraar tries to reason with him and tries to find out his religion the justification for this action any personal incidents that prompted him to take such an action etc the common man narrates an incident of how muslim woman was being tortured and molested by communal people the common man also says that he can take actions for the sufferings meted out to people from other communities too the caller threatens to blow up the remaining bombs across the city unless arif and sethu kill abdullah the chief secretary lakshmi tells maraar that the chief minister has to know about the current situation but maraar disagrees and tells her that he ll face the consequences and orders arif to kill the terrorist as natasha reports the scene on television the young hacker traces the caller location but refuses to reveal it saying that the caller was actually brainy and compared to him the hacker was only one among the billions but maraar looks in the hacker computer discovers the location and leaves abruptly towards the site the caller calls up maraar as he is on the way for final time to further reveal that he had not planted any other bomb in the city at this point maraar surprisingly declares he already knew there were no more bombs which makes it clear that his decision to kill the last terrorist wasn taken in fear but in confidence maraar reaches the caller location just as the latter is leaving the place having destroyed all his gadgets and equipments leaving behind no evidence the two meet briefly when maraar identifying the anonymous caller on the basis of the face sketch offers the man ride home and introduces himself both shake hands when maraar voice over cuts back as he says the man told him his real name but his name doesn have any significance the film ends on an idealistic note with maraar admitting that they all knew the common man was disturbed because of the insecure environment and the incompetence of the governing authorities but he never imagined him to go to such lengths and have the guts to do something like that he also repeats that the facts of this incident cannot be found in any written record but only in the memories of those who actually witnessed it and acknowledges that although the incidence has ambiguous moral significance he personally feels that whatever happened happened for the best',\n",

daughters ashley and emily carter gets turned on by seeing the twins dressed in skimpy outfits and hearing tia claim that is more clothes than they ve worn in long time makes him even more so other than that tia and kelly immediately become friends as do ashley emily and madison that night the hall twins discover website called myearth which shows satellite images of any place from space their house is not visible so buddy decides to make it so using christmas lights due to this he becomes known around the town steve is not happy about this as he is considered the christmas guy and is chairman of the town winterfest buddy also purchases large sleigh and finds horses to pull it interrupted from being able to have the family christmas picture of that year taken the finches come to see the sleigh and are invited to take their christmas pictures in it steve declines but carter enters it anyway just in time steve hears that what are modeling the reindeer are actually wild horses which he went to lot of work to catch and keep tame and in attempt to get carter out of that death trap steve frightens the horses who run away with him in the sleigh pulling him around town finally landing on thin ice and plunging into frozen river he wakes up to find himself zipped into sleeping bag naked with buddy who is also naked buddy explains that he is giving him body heat in order to keep him from dying he then starts screaming in the next scene he is recovered and back and home and sees that there was poor picture taken ruining their traditional picture for that year which has steve in an embarrassing position where he is wearing an oxygen tank tube around his nose and nothing except for boxers on where he has his uniform sweater only thrown in front of him to emulate him wearing it which he wasn he protests over the humiliation the next thing that same night steve has invited group of carolers to sing christmas carol on his front step who are eventually distracted by the hall house which has eventually become completely lit and synchronized to music over frustration of how buddy says that he is going to keep adding more and more lights and of music onto his house which would attract more and more people besides keeping him more up at night steve finally gets in full fledged revolt and decides to drive off to the sheriff office to make out warrant to arrest buddy for his intrusive tactics attempting to back out of his own driveway which is blocked by the back ends of truck and car he lets slum who happens to be drunk try to direct him out through the narrow passage causing him to lose both of his front doors he drives off anyway in his frustration and at the same time it starts to snow not being much more help to his unfortunate situation at the sheriff office after hearing steve inefficiently clarified complaints sheriff dave argues that he can arrest man for wanting to decorate his house but that due to how much he knows that steve has on his hands he would agree to have steve file complaint as much as he claims that the light deal bothers him however the reason steve fails to fully clarify the situation of his complaint and to have the complaint fulfilled is due to becoming distracted and disgusted over seeing what appears to be that sheriff dave is wearing women underwear under his officer uniform first while steve is trying to complain clearly what he is dealing with he observes what looks like sheriff dave pulling the strap behind his shirt of what looks like the shoulder lining of bra which the sheriff catches him gawking at with steve renouncing embarrassingly what he sees the sheriff claims that what he sees behind his shirt is not what he thinks where it is shoulder brace that his wife sewed for him from dislocating it they both end up laughing over what steve thought but it turns out that the sheriff did make false statement where steve was right that what he saw was bra when he sees the proof that sheriff dave is also wearing thong that goes up high above his pants when he is bending down to pull file of papers out of file cabinet through the disgust and suspicion steve immediately forfeits continuing to make his complaints and without word leaves the next night steve has had enough with being kept awake each night and with the help of carter who catches him and agrees to help him by being lookout finally fills their fuse box with snow his plan is foiled due to backup generator in revenge towards finding out what that steve blew out his power buddy pulls off couple of seriously felonous tactics on steve but making it look as though like that they are extremely generous gifts that he wants to give them to make up for the distress that he has put them through first he saws down the town christmas tree and places it in the finch living room along with giving steve mug of coffee and his newspaper and note that he places on his dining room table falsely apologizing to him and hoping that his gifts make up for the agony that he has caused steve the last big gift buddy tricks steve with that same night was by forging his signature to buy massive shiny light blue suv with red ribbon tied on the top of it when steve later after thanking him for the gifts observes that the town christmas tree is gone and is reported about the scandal that buddy has pulled on him about the new car he figures that it was all part of revenge tactics and in response to that he goes right to buddy at his office making stink about his scandals pulled against him and wanting to put up fight over that and the whole lights deal if buddy is willing but rather than having any physical fights it turns into being that buddy and steve make bet if steve beats buddy in the winterfest speedskating race then buddy removes the lights but if buddy beats steve then steve buys the car from him when the winter festival comes up and they race buddy wins and steve yells at him in front of the whole audience about how that he still appears to be nobody since the hall house is still not visible from space because of how deep in debt that buddy has become over how many lights he has purchased for his house

take their girls and leave while he is in the middle of program they go to motel to salvage the rest of christmas at in the meanwhile in frustration over how far buddy has gone with his whole lights deals steve feeling very desperate buys large amount of fireworks including large illegal military grade firework from gangster and tries to blow it up he explains to the peddler that the intent of getting every one he had is to get revenge on his neighbor buddy for his grievances by trying to set them all off at the roof of the halls house hoping to scare buddy to death in response to the program ending with buddy gloating at him by telling him over picture of him with plug presented by the lights telling him good night steve then pulling the plug that makes the lights fade away steve on his roof right across the street starts setting off the fireworks after succeeding in setting off few at the house and raving across the street about how much buddy must like having the world

that he is becoming knot in his panties indicating even more that he does cross dress in response to the incident kelly decides to take madison and carter to the same motel that tia and the girls are staying at to salvage the rest of their christmas steve and kelly get into an argument about who most is ravaging christmas and what she feels that christmas is really supposed to be all about meanwhile just as they leave buddy drives home in his truck revealing to steve that he wasn even in his home that whole night even revealing that the whole scare did turn out to be complete waste

       " 'lieutenant junior grade daniel danny kaffee is an inexperienced navy judge advocate general corps lawyer who leads the defense in the court martial of two marines private first class louden downey james marshall and lance corporal harold dawson who are accused of having murdered fellow marine of their unit pfc william santiago at the guantanamo bay naval base in cuba which is under the command of col nathan jessep santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow marines had poor relations with them and failed to respect the chain of command he went above his superiors to bargain for transfer in exchange for blowing the whistle on dawson for firing possibly illegal shot towards the cuban side of the island when the transfer request is seen by the base senior commanders there is heated argument between santiago commanding officer lt jonathan kendrick who asserts that he can handle the situation and jessep executive officer lt col matthew andrew markinson who casts doubt on kendrick ability based on past incident markinson advocates that santiago be transferred immediately for safety reasons before the request gets out but jessep says that this would set bad precedent which could cost lives jessep also states that officers have responsibility to ensure that all personnel are trained so he orders kendrick to ensure that santiago shows significant improvement on the next evaluation report or he would be held personally responsible when dawson and downey are later arrested for santiago murder naval investigator and lawyer lieutenant commander joanne galloway suspects that they were carrying out code red euphemism for violent extrajudicial punishment galloway requests to defend them but the case is instead given to kaffee who has reputation for arranging plea bargains there is initial friction between them as she believes he negotiates plea bargains to avoid having to argue in court and he claims that she is interfering with his handling of the case however their relationship strengthens as the trial progresses as does kaffee effectiveness as lawyer despite goading by galloway and dawson to allow the trial go to court kaffee initially tries to step down as lead counsel for the defense his argument being that since he cannot prove that any order was given for the assault making legal stand simply because he believes the marines did as they were told was futile gesture however galloway successfully argues her point of view to kaffee after dawson and downey state they were ordered by lieutenant kendrick to shave santiago head minutes after kendrick ordered the platoon not to touch the would be victim santiago actually died from asphyxiation after rag was shoved into his mouth as gag kaffee comes to realize that for legal officer of his limited time and experience to be given such an important case is unusual and he accepts that he was probably assigned to it due to his reputation for plea bargaining indicating that someone high up did not want the case to reach court so he changes his mind and agrees to proceed kaffee suspicions are confirmed when he rejects plea bargain offer from prosecutor capt jack ross who is friend of his ross then warns that the government case against the two marines is strong and that kaffee could risk his reputation for any attempt to smear high ranking officers in making futile defense in the course of the trial it is established that code reds are standard in guantanamo bay as means of enforcing discipline and getting sloppy marines to follow procedure kaffee especially goes after kendrick particularly over the fact that he denied dawson promotion after the latter helped out fellow marine who was under what could be seen as code red lieutenant colonel markinson has gone absent without leave since the incident but he resurfaces in kaffee car during the trial revealing that jessep never intended to transfer santiago off the base as previously claimed but created the transfer orders as part of cover up long after santiago death kaffee is unable to find evidence corroborating these claims and announces his intention to have markinson testify rather than publicly dishonor himself and the marine corps markinson sends letter to santiago parents blaming his own weakness for the loss of their son outfits himself in full dress blue uniform and commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth with his service pistol without markinson crucial testimony kaffee believes that the case is lost and returns home after drunken stupor having come to regret that he fought the case instead of considering the plea bargain galloway however convinces kaffee to take the great risk of calling colonel jessep as witness kaffee initially questions jessep travel habits versus that of santiago in an attempt to argue that the transfer order was never properly conducted however jessep successfully outsmarts kaffee by saying that he cannot speculate on santiago habits and he becomes particularly disdainful of kaffee and the court proceedings kaffee is stumped but then he manages to unnerve jessep by pointing out flaw in his testimony he had stated that santiago was due to be transferred off the base for his own safety in case the other marines sought retribution but also stated that marines are honorable men who always follow orders thus if the other marines were ordered to leave santiago alone and always follow orders then santiago would have been in no danger whatsoever and would not have to be transferred under heavy pressure from kaffee and unnerved by being caught in one of his own lies jessep furiously declares you can handle the truth he then dismisses kaffee as disrespectful of marine doing his duty ultimately confessing that he did order the code red as jessep angrily justifies his actions on the basis of national security he is arrested by ross and there is verdict of not guilty on the murder charges for dawson and downey ross informs kaffee he will now have kendrick arrested for the same charges faced by dawson and downey nonetheless the two marines are dishonorably discharged for having caused santiago death through their conduct unbecoming united states marine downey does not understand why they are being given dishonorable discharges but dawson accepts the verdict and explains to downey that they had failed to stand up for those too weak to stand up for themselves like santiago as the two prepare to leave kaffee tells dawson he does not need patch on his arm to have honor dawson who had previously been reluctant to respect kaffee as an officer barks ten hut there an officer on deck and salutes kaffee',\n",

real agenda for being in tasmania secret the loggers warn him that if he doesn leave he will end up like armstrong husband and so with nowhere else to turn david is forced to stay at the armstrong home not long after his arrival david is met by local guide named jack mindy who gives him brief synopsis of the environment and travels with him on his first outing mindy remains suspicious of david true intentions throughout the story during his stay david goes into the bush for twelve days at time setting up various steel traps and makeshift snares while waiting patiently to see if the tiger will surface he checks his traps regularly to see if the animal has been caught and slowly befriends the armstrong children he helps reduce lucy dependency on medication in addition to fixing the generator the story reveals that the pills are being prescribed by her doctor and delivered by jack mindy who has been unofficially looking in on the family from time to time david later confronts mindy and suggests that it may not be good idea for him to be visiting the armstrong family as david suspects that mindy has an unhealthy obsession with lucy armstrong eventually lucy makes full recovery and starts taking better care of her children while befriending david at the same time the son bike provides david with clues as to the tasmanian tiger whereabouts by drawing picture of it next to spots of water these clues were predicated on the fact that jarrah armstrong had also been searching for the tiger and was communicating his findings to bike david discovers that red leaf had initially contracted jarrah to locate it pursuit he eventually abandoned in favor of taking up an environmental cause to protect the wildlife lucy armstrong informs david that red leaf wanted jarrah to find the tiger because they believe that it has venom in its bite that can cause paralysis which they could then use for military purposes while david continues his search for the tasmanian tiger trouble escalates as mindy becomes jealous of david interactions with the armstrong family remembering that red leaf had advised him to contact them should there be any problems mindy calls them and reports that david is spending more time with armstrong and her two children in lieu of doing what he was hired to do red leaf contacts david and reminds him of what they are paying him to find david assures them that he has found the tiger den during his travels but red leaf insists that he put his work first and drop any more fraternization with armstrong david now torn between his friendship with the family and his loyalty to red leaf reluctantly heads back into the bush much to the disappointment of armstrong and her children before leaving he gives lucy piece of his map that has his coordinates on it in case he does not come back within twelve days david meanwhile discovers the location of the tiger den as well as the remains of jarrah armstrong and is accosted by another company operative who has been sent in by red leaf to replace him the operative follows david into the bush and holds him at gunpoint demanding that he show him the tiger den david cunningly manages to lead the operative into one of his steel traps and while freeing himself is able to kill his captor after searching the body he finds the piece of his map with his coordinates that he left for lucy in the armstrong house now cognizant of the fact that armstrong and her children may be in grave danger david returns to find their home burnt down david confronts mindy who tells him that lucy and sass were killed in the fire saying it to be an accident but it is discovered that by reporting david to red leaf mindy may have been indirectly responsible for their deaths mindy informs david that bike managed to survive and had been sent away to live in an orphanage david angrily reprimands an emotionally remorseful mindy and leaves him to wallow in his grief angered and frustrated david sets out into the bush to find the tasmanian tiger and put an end to red leaf pursuit when he awakens next to the den the following morning he looks up to see the tiger staring at him from ledge above as the tiger turns and calmly walks away david climbs the ledge pursues the creature and after an initial emotional hesitation reluctantly shoots it david then approaches the dying tiger and becomes emotionally overwrought he then proceeds to cremate the tiger in order to remove all traces of its existence and the next day scatters its ashes to the wind using the water bottle of jarrah armstrong david returns to town and calls red leaf from payphone informing them that what they are looking for is gone forever and likewise tells them not to bother looking for him the very last scene shows david arriving at the orphanage when bike sees david he runs excitedly toward him says something inaudible and the two embrace',\n",

heywood floyd head of the national council on astronautics received the blame for the failure and left the nca since then he has been the chancellor of the university of hawaii while diplomatic tensions are growing between the united states and the soviet union both nations prepare space missions to determine what happened to the discovery although the soviet ship the alexei leonov will be ready before the american ship the soviets need american astronauts to help board the discovery and investigate hal malfunction the us government agrees to joint mission since it has been determined that discovery will crash into jupiter moon io before its ship is ready floyd along with discovery designer walter curnow and hal creator dr chandra join the russian mission upon leonovs arrival at jupiter captain tanya kirbuk and the other soviets wake floyd early from his hibernation because they have detected the presence of chlorophyll and other chemical signatures of life on jupiter frozen moon europa an unmanned probe is sent from the leonov to investigate the readings coming from europa but just as it finds the source mysterious energy burst destroys the probe as well as all telemetry data recorded by it the burst then flies at great speed towards jupiter though the soviet crew believes the burst was simply electromagnetic radiation floyd suspects that it was actually warning to stay away from europa after surviving dangerous aerocapture through jupiter upper atmosphere the leonov crew find the discovery abandoned but undamaged orbiting the planet close to io curnow reactivates the ship and chandra restarts hal which dave bowman had deactivated shortly before he disappeared also close by is the alien monolith that was the purpose of the discovery mission cosmonaut max brailovsky travels to the monolith in an eva pod at which point the monolith temporarily reopens to allow dave bowman now being of pure energy to return to earth max is swept away when the monolith opens and is never seen again on earth dave bowman now an incorporeal being but with all the memories of his former human self appears on his widow television screen and wishes her farewell he also visits his terminally ill mother in nursing home and brushes her hair just before she dies peacefully back on the discovery chandra discovers the reason for hal malfunction the nsc ordered the computer to conceal from discoverys crew the fact that the mission was about the monolith this conflicted with hal basic function of open accurate processing of information causing him to suffer mental breakdown this was done without floyd knowledge even though the order bears his signature outraging floyd on earth tensions between the united states and soviet union escalate to what is technically state of war and the us government orders floyd curnow and chandra to move into discovery both crews plan to leave jupiter separately when launch window opens in several weeks however bowman appears and tells floyd that everybody must leave jupiter space within two days because something wonderful is going to happen floyd shocked to the core by bowman appearance returns to the leonov to talk to kirbuk but then the monolith suddenly disappears and growing black spot appears on jupiter itself the spot is actually vast group of monoliths that are constantly multiplying the monoliths begin shrinking jupiter volume increasing the planet density and modifying the chemical properties of its atmosphere this convinces the two crews that they must leave soon since neither ship can reach earth with an early departure they work together to use the discovery as booster rocket for the leonov tension arises when hal is not told that the discovery will be left stranded in space and possibly destroyed and chandra fears that another deception may cause hal to malfunction again during the launch countdown chandra finally tells the computer the truth hal agrees that he must sacrifice himself for the human beings onboard leonov to complete discoverys mission and thanks chandra for telling him the truth as leonov and discovery launch away bowman appears once again to hal and tells him that their mission has been success and repeats that something wonderful is going to happen he commands hal to break his communication link with the leonov and to repeatedly broadcast final message to earth samp jupiter is engulfed by monoliths which increase its density to the point that nuclear fusion occurs transforming the planet into small star discovery is consumed in the
