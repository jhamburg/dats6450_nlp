protection behind the containment wall police checkpoints stop anybody going in or out three years later an almost feudal system has developed amongst the street gangs of the area is now flooded with hard drugs such as heroin and completely controlled by gangsters certain blocks are ruled over by various individuals and one high rise apartment block is looked after by an athletic and street wise man known as leïto leïto hates drugs and injustice and wages one man war against neighboring gang lord named taha bemamud to keep his own building and people safe and free of drugs leïto captures nbsp kg of cocaine from taha worth over million euro which incites taha to send his thugs to recover the merchandise led by the towering leïto destroys the cocaine by using bleach and uses parkour to evade taha thugs through the building and across rooftops taha kidnaps leïto younger sister lola to use against him but leïto manages to invade taha base rescue his sister and kidnap taha in turn leïto takes taha to the police office at the edge of the district perimeter but the police are in the process of abandoning their position on orders from the french ministry and are also threefold outnumbered by taha gang the police release taha and allow him to take lola with him to avoid confrontation in addition they put leïto in cell also to contain the situation but leïto kills the police chief in the process for handing over lola six months later outside of in the affluent areas of paris an undercover police captain named damien tomaso infiltrates an underground casino and attempts to arrest carlos montoya the gangster who owns it his extraction procedure fails however forcing him to fight his way through an army of thugs to escape the casino upon the mission completion damien immediately receives another assignment from his chief and also the defence secretary of france mr krüger he is told that taha has stolen an experimental neutron bomb that is set to detonate in hours his mission is to convince leïto imprisoned for months to lead him to taha base so that he can disarm the bomb damien attempts to pass himself off as fellow prisoner and helps leïto escape to but leïto sees through damien act and abandons him after fighting off some of the local thugs damien locates leïto and admits the truth they team up to disarm the bomb and rescue lola the pair surrenders to taha in order to gain access to his base there they discover that taha has rigged the warhead to missile launcher pointed towards the center of paris and is prepared to blackmail the government with it taha demands high ransom which is refused by damien government contact the pair escape and while taha thugs pursue them he discovers that the government has emptied all of his offshore accounts in the bahamas and elsewhere one of taha men asks how taha will pay them frustrated taha tries to shoot the member who asked him that only to discover that his gun is empty taha offers money from safe he possesses but knowing that with tahas accounts emptied there is no reason to endure his ruthlessness any longer the thugs shoot and kill taha this leaves more sympathetic leader in charge and has moment of reconciliation with leïto suggesting that peace is possible in the future within leïto and damien fight their way to the tower building holding lola and the bomb they are confronted by their final obstacle yeti substantial henchman left by taha to block their access to the bomb damien underestimates yeti and tries attacking him but is gradually overpowered leito helps out damien and gains the upper hand with the henchman by tying him up with an electricity cord damien then picks up brick and smashes it on yeti head knocking him out having defeated yeti damien calls his contact to receive the deactivation code leïto recognizes the code as reference to the bomb location the day date and the district leïto deduces that the government has set them up and the code will actually detonate the bomb instead of deactivating it he fights damien to prevent him who chose to believe in the government over leito from entering the code the timer runs out and the bomb does not detonate proving leïto theory the pair return to the government building with the bomb and use it to force mr krüger admit that he had planned to blow up as means to get rid of it the confession is then revealed to have been filmed and is immediately broadcast by pirate television transmission across all channels the pair actions cause major scandal that sparks public support for soon the rest
